This project allows you to control various devices (LED, RGB LED, relay) using the **ESP32** module and communication via **MQTT**. Simply adjust the device type and configure the server addresses, and you can start controlling your devices via **MQTT**.

## 🌟 Main advantages of **ESP32** **MQTT** control

### 🔧 Flexibility
- This project is designed to be easily expandable to different types of devices.
- Simply change the configuration, and you can add new devices without major code modifications.

### 🛠️ Easy Configuration
- Configuration is simple and straightforward.
- Just modify a few variables, and your **ESP32** module will communicate with the **MQTT** server and control your devices.

## 🚀 How to get started with **ESP32** and **MQTT**

### 📋 Prerequisites
- Ensure you have an **ESP32** module and the necessary peripherals (LED, RGB LED, relay) available.

### ⚙️ Setup
1. Open the code and edit the configuration file for your project.
2. Change the device type (LED, RGB LED, relay) and set the **MQTT** server addresses.

### 📥 Uploading the Code
- Upload the modified code to your **ESP32** module.

### 🎮 Usage
- Remotely control your devices using **MQTT** messages.
